browsing cubes, some routing and express stuff

1.	Create Model
1.1	Cube Model
Each cube should have the following properties (for now it could be an ES6 class):
•	Id - number
•	Name – string
•	Description – string 
•	Image URL – string
•	Difficulty Level– number
2.	Storage
Store the cubes inside a /config/database.json
3.	Create Routes
You should implement the following routes:
•	/ - the main page (should visualize all the cubes in the database and a search field)
•	/about – should render the about page
•	/create – should render the create cube form
•	/details/:id – should render the details page about selected cube
•	Any other -  should render the 404 not found page
